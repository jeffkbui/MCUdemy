# README

Welcome to MCUdemy! This is my version of the online education platform, Udemy, except it's themed with topics only on the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

## Overview

This site is inspired by Udemy. It allows users to sign up for a new account, log in and log out of an existing account, log into the provided demo user, and edit user account information to demonstrate a full CRUD cycle. When logged in, the demo provides each person with a single course 'lecture' that they can view. 

Without logging in, user will be able to browse a selection of courses that are available to them. They can click into each of the course's 'show' page to view more details of each individual course. Also, users will be able to click a preview of the course, which will give them access to 15 seconds of the course material.

## Backend

Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Webpack and NPM

## Frontend

JavaScript, React, Redux, HTML5, CSS3

## Challenges

Building this site was fun and very fulfilling, but there were a few challenges that were faced when attempting to create this clone in just 2 weeks. One key challenge was the fact that Udemy is a platform where instructors can sign up to create course content. Originally, the site was to include that feature, but the limitation to access Udemy's instructor view without paying halted that idea.

Another challenge was seeding the database with videos. It was difficult to figure out a way to collect that much free video content that matched a 'course' structure. In the end, I relied on YouTube to host these videos, which is a good choice since these videos give free access to content and didn't force me to use a crowded server. However, the only problem is that each video now has the YouTube branding that cannot be removed, and the button on each video thumbnail automatically plays the video, unlike how Udemy courses use those thumbnails to redirect to it's show page.
